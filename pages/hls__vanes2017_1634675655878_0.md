- ## Распространение и клинические характеристики наиболее распространенных проявлений бокового амиотрофического склероза в зависимости от назначения и места начала заболевания
Classic ALS (70%)
	 - Bulbar (33%) - Bulbar with involvement of other regions
		 - Dysarthria is the presenting feature in all patients with bulbar-onset ALS, and dysphagia usually develops later (although can develop simultaneously) in the disease; bulbar upper motor neuron signs include exaggerated jaw jerk, pseudobulbar affect, and spasticity; bulbar lower motor neuron signs include tongue wasting (never asymmetrical) and fasciculations; patients with bulbar onset generally present with both upper and lower motor neuron signs

	 - Spinal (66%) - Flail arm, Flail leg, Hemiplegic, Pseudopolyneuritic
		 - Lower motor neuron involvement proximally in the arms, often with mild upper motor neuron signs in the legsLower motor neuron involvement restricted to the legs, usually asymmetricalProgressive, unilateral upper motor neuron involvement with facial sparing, sometimes with discrete lower motor neuron involvementPredominantly distal lower motor neuron signs in the limbs with limited upper motor neuron involvement

	 - ALS–FTD (5–15%)

	 - Bulbar or spina - Distribution as in classical ALS
		 - Classic ALS with a spinal or bulbar onset, but also signs of cognitive or behavioural changes, or both, fulfilling the diagnostic criteria for FTD (5–15% of ALS patients); patients most commonly have behavioural variant FTD with apathy and loss of sympathy as the commonly affected behavioural domains; semantic dementia is also seen; the non-fluent and logopenic variants are very rare or not encountered; take a careful family history and explicitly ask for dementia, Parkinson’s disease, psychiatric disease, suicide, and addiction; associated with repeat expansions in C9orf72

	 - Isolated bulbar involvement (5%) - Pseudobulbar palsy, isolated bulbar palsy - Bulbar Bulbar only

	 - Some patients present with bulbar signs that remain restricted to the bulbar region for an extended period of time (years) without spreading to other regions (as would be seen in bulbar-onset ALS); patients are predominantly women, have a spastic dysarthria, and commonly have emotional lability

	 - Restricted phenotypes of ALS (10%) -

	 - Progressive spinal muscular atrophy (only lower motor neuron involvement) - Spinal - Spreading from a focal onset or patchy
		 - Generalised lower motor neuron involvement; onset can be focal or patchy, but there is clear progression to other regions with time, eventually leading to respiratory failure; average survival is longer than for classical ALS; patients should be followed regularly as upper motor neuron involvement can become apparent during the disease course

	 - Primary lateral sclerosis (only upper motor involvement) - Bulbar or lower limbsSpread from bulbar to limbs, from legs to arms and bulbar region; can be one-sided (Mill’s syndrome)
		 - Exclusive upper motor neuron signs for more than 4 years; in upper motor neuron-predominant ALS, lower motor neuron signs can become evident with time; when upper motor neuro signs are symmetrical and limited to the legs (sporadic), hereditary spastic paraplegia is an important diagnostic consideration; survival ranges from more than 10 years to normal life expectancy

	 - Rare phenotypes (3%) -

	 - Cachexia - Develops into classic ALS
		 - Unexplained weight loss may precede upper motor neuron or lower motor neuron signs, or both

	 - Respiratory onset, diaphragm and neck flexors - Diaphragm and neck flexors
		 - Usually referred by cardiologist or pulmonologist; initial consult is often in the intensive care unit; weakness of diaphragm and neck flexors; associated with poor prognosis

- # Cognitive and behavioural changes

- 5–15%    of    patients    with    ALS    also    have    frontotemporal  dementia,  and  up  to  50%  of  patients  with  ALS  have  cognitive  or  behavioural  changes  within  the  spectrum  of  frontotemporal  dementia.

- 

- Functionally, the 30 genes associated with familial ALS11can   be   grouped   into   three   main   pathophysiological   processes—RNA  biology,  protein  turnover,  and  axonal  transport, suggesting that deficits in these pathways are causal.

- In  a  study  with  patients  with  Alzheimer’s  disease,126the   monoclonal   antibody   aducanumab   was   shown   to   selectively   target   aggregated   Aβ   and   reduce   the   concentration  of  soluble  and  insoluble  Aβ  in  a  dose-dependent manner. Monthly intravenous infusions were also  found  to  slow  memory  decline  in  patients  with  prodromal  or  mild  Alzheimer’s  disease.126  One  could  therefore  contemplate  targeting  TDP-43  in  a  similar  fashion. TDP-43 synthesis is, however, tightly regulated, and overexpression and knock-down could be detrimental and far from straightforward.

- # Biomarkers

- Muscle  strength  and  respiratory  function  have  been  studied  extensively  as  markers  of  disease  progression.  Muscle  strength  can  be  measured  in  several  ways.146–148Hand-held   dynamometry   is   probably   the   preferred   method  because  it  is  easy,  cheap,  quantitative,  reliable,  and reproducibly measures decreases in muscle strength in   patients   with   ALS.

- Considering  that  TDP-43 aggregation is the pathological hallmark of ALS, it  stands  to  reason  that  being  able  to  image  TDP-43  aggregation in vivo, as is possible with amyloid and Tau, could  be  a  powerful  biomarker  for  all  disease  aspects,  and efforts to this end are underway.
